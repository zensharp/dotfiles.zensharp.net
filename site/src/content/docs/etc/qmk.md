# Layers

| Number | Trigger Method | Left hand | Right hand |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Hardware switch | Base (macOS) | Base |
| 1 | Hardware switch | Base (Windows) |  |
| 2 | fn1 |  | Numpad |
| 3 | Left alt | Media Keys | Arrow keys, edit keys |

## Misc
* Instead of the usual vim-style navigation key arrangement, IJKL minimizes finger movements (and is more intuitive)
* Instead of the usual WASD media keys arrangement, ESDF minimizes finger movements.
* The numpad uses a modified Apple-style numpad arrangement.
